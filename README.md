# OddEvenNumber
A simple Python script that checks if a given integer is an even or odd number.

# Even or Odd Number Checker

A basic Python script that determines whether an integer provided by the user is even or odd. This is a classic beginner project for practicing fundamental concepts like user input and conditional logic.

## How to Use

1.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `checker.py`).
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python OddEven.py
    ```
4.  The program will prompt you to enter a number. After you provide the input, it will print whether the number is "even" or "odd".

## Logic

The script uses the modulo operator (`%`) to determine the result.

* An integer is **even** if the remainder of its division by 2 is `0` (`num % 2 == 0`).
* Otherwise, the number is **odd**.
